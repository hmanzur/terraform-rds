# Terraform Example: AWS RDS Instance

This repository contains a Terraform configuration to provision an AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) instance.

## Purpose

This example demonstrates how to use Terraform to create a managed database service on AWS. It includes the necessary configuration for defining the database engine, version, instance size, storage, and basic network settings.

## Prerequisites

Before using this example, you should have the following:

* **Terraform installed:** Ensure you have Terraform installed on your local machine or in your environment. You can find installation instructions on the [official Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
* **AWS Account:** You need an active AWS account with appropriate permissions to create RDS instances and related resources (like VPC security groups and subnets, if you are not using the default).
* **AWS CLI configured:** The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) should be configured with your AWS credentials. Terraform uses these credentials to authenticate with AWS.

## Configuration

The main Terraform configuration files are:

* `main.tf`: Contains the resource definitions for the RDS instance. (You would replace this with your actual Terraform code for creating the RDS instance).
* `variables.tf`: (Optional) Can contain variable definitions for customizable parameters like instance size or database name.
* `outputs.tf`: (Optional) Can contain output definitions to display useful information after the RDS instance is created, such as the database endpoint.

**Note:** The actual Terraform configuration for creating the RDS instance (`main.tf`) is not included in this README. You should replace the content of `main.tf` with your specific Terraform code for defining your RDS instance.

## Execution with GitHub Actions

This Terraform example can be easily executed using GitHub Actions for automated infrastructure provisioning. Here's a basic example of a GitHub Actions workflow file ([`.github/workflows/terraform.yml`](`.github/workflows/terraform.yml`)).
